This is a collection of all my dotfiles for my development environment. So far I've only tested it on
Ubuntu 18.04. Run `sudo install.sh` from the project root to install all of the dotfiles. The `-f`
flag will remove any files that conflict with files to be installed.

As of now `install.sh` has to be executed from the project root.
